# CIS-343-Project-1

By: Andy hing Hung & Javier Ramirez

The Game of Life was developed by John Conway (a British mathematician) in the 1970s. It is an example of a cellular automaton, a data structure that seems to evolve iteratively. In this simulation we will use a set of rules to determine the survival or death of the cells.

In this assignment we will focus our attention mostly on memory allocation & memory management in general.
